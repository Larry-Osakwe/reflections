How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing the diff between two version helped see the bug because instead of
	combing thru the entire code, the diff command showed what was different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Makes me a better programmer by allowing me to take bigger risks in my code
	knowing that I have a back up file just in case.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros of manually choosing to save files include knowing the final versions
	you want to save. If google is automaticaly saving your work, it could accidentally
	save a mistake that you can't revert.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I'm not really sure. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log lets you see every commit that has happened and diff allows you to see the differences
	between the files through their file ID

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can freely break my code knowing that I have a back up.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to easily share revisions between multiple devices. I have a desktop
	at home and a laptop for mobile use.
