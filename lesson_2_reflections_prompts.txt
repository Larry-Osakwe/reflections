What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository it looks like the file i use the git init 
	command creates a .git file. This probably allows me to use the git commands
	we previously learned on the folder/repository. git diff, git checkout, git log
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	I think the staging area is a quick sanity check for the user to make sure
	they are commiting exactly what they want to commit because while in the 
	staging area, there's an opportunity to back out
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By using git diff I can see the changes between my working directory and staging area.
	The staging area lets you decide which files you want to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
	
	Branhes would be helpful by giving the user the choice to experiment or change functionalites
	without altering the master code.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	
	The diagrams help me visualie the branch stuctures by showing literal branches.
	I can see exactly where a branch is created and then what becomes the working code
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	Merging two brnaches together combined the code of the master as well as additional features
	being developed by another person. We represent it the way we do because we can looks back at 
	previous commis through both branches and combine the relevant code.
