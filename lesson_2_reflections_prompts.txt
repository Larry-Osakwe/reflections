What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository it looks like the file i use the git init 
	command creates a .git file. This probably allows me to use the git commands
	we previously learned on the folder/repository. git diff, git checkout, git log
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	I think the staging area is a quick sanity check for the user to make sure
	they are commiting exactly what they want to commit because while in the 
	staging area, there's an opportunity to back out
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By using git diff I can see the changes between my working directory and staging area.
	The staging area lets you decide which files you want to commit.
