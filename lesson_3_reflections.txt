When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	You would want to create a remote repository when you want to push or pull from
	GitHub.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

	Forks makes copies of existing repositories on github server. Clones makes a copy of a github
	repository and sends that copy to your local station. Branches are paths in your code that can 
	deviate from the master. You'd fork if you wanted to make a copy of a respository and create your
	own remote and not affect the original. You'd clone if you were fine pushing/pulling to/from the
	same remote. You'd branch if you wanted to keep the master the same.
